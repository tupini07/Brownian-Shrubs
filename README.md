# Brownian-Shrubs
Procedural shrubs generation with three.js and brownian motion!

## To Run:
You need to have npm's http-server installed, this is so that browser's "Same Origin Policy" security restrictions don't bother us when we want to load external resources. 

To install it just run: `npm install http-server -g` and once it's installed you can run the application with `http-server .` executed from within the project's directory. Very Simple.
